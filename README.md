# Bitburner
This is a repo for scripts created for my run through [Bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/).

## How It Works
I write my scripts in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is compiled into [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). After being checked into this GitHub repo, I just need run import.js ingame to import these files for use.

## Credits
Heavily influenced by work done by [ChaelCodes](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/bitburner-scripts).
