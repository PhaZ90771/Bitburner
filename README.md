# Bitburner
This is a repo for scripts created for my run through [Bitburner](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/).

## Build Pipeline
Scripts are written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is compiled into [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Ingame
Just call `run /scripts/import.js` to pull the latest files.

## Credits
Heavily influenced by work done by [ChaelCodes](https://github.com/ChaelCodes/bitburner-scripts).
